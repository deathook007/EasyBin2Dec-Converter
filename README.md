# Easy-Bin2Dec-converter:

### Bin2Dec-

Built an easy, fun to use Binary 2 Decimal converter using HTML, CSS(Basic) and JAVASCRIPT(Basic)

### What I learned in this short fun project (Pro's)
.
- I have used `parseInt()` function and how it takes in string/number argument and returns an integer of the specified `radix` (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
- In above, I passed a `redix` or `base` of 2 specifying function should return a Decimal value.

### What I should've also done (Con's)

- I should've added regex validation for input feild reather than `alert`ing a message when keycode is not `0 or 1`.
